  Note           = {The emerging fields of academic analytics and
                   educational data mining are rapidly producing new
                   possibilities for gathering, analyzing, and presenting
                   student data. Faculty might soon be able to use these
                   new data sources as guides for course redesign and as
                   evidence for implementing new assessments and lines of
                   communication between instructors and students. This
                   essay links the concepts of academic analytics, data
                   mining in higher education, and course management
                   system audits and suggests how these techniques and the
                   data they produce might be useful to those who practice
                   the scholarship of teaching and learning.},
