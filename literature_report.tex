% Use psychological evidence to determine key-factors in motivation and how it improves learning


% Introduce Gamification and Learning Analytics as solutions to this motivation problem



% Research Questions


% Overview of Paper

\section{Gamification}
In March 2004 the term gamification was coined by Nick Pelling, but did not become popular until 2010. The term refers to the usage of game-design elements in mostly non-gaming contexts. Gamification was mostly a marketing-term \cite{Huotari2011}, but slowly began to be used to define the academic practice \cite{Deterding2011} of applying game design patterns to increase motivation and engagement. An example of this is the usage of narrative to change routine work into something more meaningful, such as changing math problems into real-life examples with an underlying math problem (CITE).

An important underlying idea is ``playfulness'' (CITE) which is a concept addressing how much fun it is to do something. However, a consensus about the exact definition of this playfulness has yet to emerge, many researchers have described it as a desirable user experience or interaction. The term is described as making a standard interaction ``fun'' (CITE) or making it a ``pleasurable experience.''

Deterding et al \cite{Deterding2011} makes a distinction between ``gamefulness'' and ``playfulness'' by saying that the first is a subfield (?) of the latter where the play is done according to strict rules that are enforced.
