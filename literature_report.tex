\section{Learning Analytics}
Large amounts of students that are studying with a decreasing amount of contact hours can cause problems for a teacher that wants to keep track of progress in the group and wants to adjust his teaching methods to specific learner's needs. At the same time, we observe that the learning increasingly takes place in digital environments that are able to track students and have the potential of interacting on a personalized level due to the fact that each student runs his own instance of such systems. The enourmous amounts of data that are gathered in this way can be analysed automatically and used to base system actions on.

Teachers are typically not able to analyse the large amounts of data themselves, however they can act upon summarized information that can be supplied by such a system. Teachers are able to give specific aid to a few struggling students, if they would know which students are struggling.

Teachers also typically have difficulties with identifying problematic components in their suggested curriculum. These problematic components are sometimes visible to students, but the feedback resulting from that to the teacher is not always sufficient. Sometimes these problematic components are not even that clear to students, since they could also explain their struggling with other factors.

Students are also affected by the reduction in personal education due to student increase. They get less feedback on their own progress and also have the risk of being stuck too long because they are not directed to other resources to get them over the edge.

Using the large amounts of data to give feedback on the learning process to both teachers and students is called Learning Analytics.

\subsection{Introduction, Definition, Subcategories}
According to the 1st International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge\cite{lak2011}:
\begin{quote}
"Learning analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimising learning and the environments in which it occurs."
\end{quote}
